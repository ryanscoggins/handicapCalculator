Match Handicap Calculator
Overview
This application is designed to help make two-versus-two scramble golf matches more fair by taking into account the players' handicaps. In a scramble format, teammates work together to play the best shot on each hole. By calculating team handicaps, this app ensures that players of different skill levels can compete on a more even playing field.

Features

How to Use
